Tips for Heuristics:
1. There are no solutions when there are either obstacles or walls in 3 adjacent tiles next to any given snowball.

2. Splitting edge cases for each snowball getting stuck into separate helper functions helps the flow of the code and organization overall.

3. Try to loop only have one loop per heuristic function, as each loop increases runtime quite a lot.

4. Adjusting the values added to heuristics by using non integer values helps gauge how important each optimization is (reduced the importance of Manhattan distance for me).

5. Find a data structure to help iterate over the obstacles creating a stuck box, as iterating through the obstacles each time it's checked costs a lot of time.
